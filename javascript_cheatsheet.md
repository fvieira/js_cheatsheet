## Simple values

Values are used to represent concepts.
There are multiple types of values, with different purposes, explained below


#### Numbers
Examples: `0`, `1`, `1987`, `-3`, `2.5`, `3.14`, `12345.6789`

Concept examples:
- number of fingers in a hand (`5`)
- number of pages in a book (e.g. `614`)
- a person's height in meters (e.g. `1.80`)
- account balance in euros (e.g. `-160`, someone used their credit card too much)

#### Booleans

## Operators

Operators transform values into other values.
They can be unary (if they transform 1 value into another), binary (if they transform 2 values into another) or ternary (if they transform 3 values into another).

#### Arithmetic operators
- `+`
    - `2 + 3` -> `5`
    - `2.87 + 6` -> `8.87`
    - `+4` -> `4` (both examples above use `+` as a binary operator; it can also be used as an unary operator as in this example, but it's a bit useless given that it just transforms the number into itself)

- `-`
